# Blockchain Ledger

Blockchain Ledger is a blockchain-chain based ledger that will mimic financial transfers between a sender and receiver. The application will demonstrate cryptography concepts used in blockchain technology with the purpose to uphold the integrity of financial transactions. The Streamlit library will be imported into the application to build out a web interface within the python script. The final .py file will run using Streamlit to view the Blockchain Ledger in a web browser end users to add and store data in the blockchain ledger and view all transactions on the blockchain.

## Technologies

Blockchain Ledger leverages Python 3.7 with the following libraries:

Streamlit: Python library used to build web interfaces for Python applications

Pandas: Python library for data analysis and manipulation

data class: Python data container that can be used to create data structure blocks that can store data records

datetime: Classes for manipulating dates and times in Python

hashlib: Python Library that contains industry-standard hashing functions
